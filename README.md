# codedump

Basically a storehouse for a bunch of useful, and some not-so-useful bits of
code. Started off as just some C and web programs, but now expanded to a lot of
stuff.

## Guide to the dump

Here's a guide to the content in all the folders.

### asm

Consists of programs written in Intel 8085 and 8086 assembly.

### c

A large number of programs for doing various basic things in C; written as I 
learnt the language.

### cpp

Similar to the folder `c`, but for C++.

### dsa

A result of me learning data structures. Contains of plenty of data structures
as well as algorithms, as well as some markdown files describing specific ones.
Most of the implementations are written in Dart because I like that language,
however there are also some C++ implementations, along with the C implementations
in the `4th_sem_dsa` which is purely for DSA stuff I did for college.

### fortran

A small number of Fortran programs I wrote in college.

### numerical_meth

Implementations of various numerical methods in C. Also done in college.

### web

Some simple programs I wrote a long time back when I was first learning the
basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript; as well as some PHP from highschool.
