# codedump

Basically a storehouse for a bunch of useful, and some not-so-useful bits of
code. Started off as just some C and web programs, but now expanded to a lot of
stuff.

## Guide to the dump

Here's a guide to the content in all the folders.

### asm

Consists of programs written in 8085 assembly, and a bit of 8086 assembly.

### c

A large number of programs for doing various basic things in C; written as I 
learnt the language.

### coa

Some binary arithmetic algorithms for Computer Organization & Architecture (COA).

### cpp

Similar to the folder `c`, but for C++.

### data_communication

MATLAB/Octave programs to learn the basics of signal manipulation.

### dsa

A result of me learning data structures. Contains of plenty of data structures
as well as algorithms, as well as some markdown files describing specific ones.
Most of the implementations are written in Dart because I like that language,
however there are also some C++ implementations, along with a lot of C 
implementations in the `4th_sem_dsa` which is purely for DSA stuff I did for 
college.

### fortran

A few Fortran programs I wrote in college.

### graphics

Implementation of various graphics algorithms in Python using the `pygame`
library.

### numerical_meth

Implementations of various numerical methods in C. Also done in college.

### vhdl

Some hardware descriptions in VHDL done as part of my Embedded Systems course.

### web

Some simple programs I wrote a long time back when I was first learning the
basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript; as well as some PHP from highschool.
