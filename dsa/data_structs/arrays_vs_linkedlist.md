# arrays?

- ez to access items
- super fast since everything O(1)

but they're static so you can't grow it

# linked list

- allows to grow the list

but, slow since you need to traverse the entire list to
get some item. That destroys performance.

There's a tradeoff to both approaches.

An arraylist provides the best of both worlds.
